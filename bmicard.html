            <p class="text-muted">
                Body Mass Index, or BMI, is a number that helps us understand if our weight is healthy for our height. It is calculated by dividing your weight by how tall you are. A healthy BMI is important because it helps your body work well, including your menstrual cycle. When a person's BMI is too low or too high, it can affect how regular and healthy their periods are. For example, if your BMI is too low, your body might not have enough energy to have regular periods, and if it's too high, it can also affect hormone levels that control your cycle. Keeping a healthy weight helps your body stay balanced and supports your overall health, including having normal periods.
