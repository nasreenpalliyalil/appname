### Project Description
This project aims to educate children, about menstruation and the changes of puberty in a clear, age-appropriate manner. It provides accessible, engaging resources to help normalize conversations about periods, reduce stigma, and empower kids with essential knowledge. The initiative also fosters open dialogue with caregivers and educators for a supportive learning experience.

### The Problem statement
Many kids especially pre-teens including boys, face a lack of understanding and awareness about menstruation, leading to misconceptions and confusions. Boys, in particular, may not be educated about periods, resulting in embarrasssment, stigmatization, or even the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. For girls, the absence of accurate, age-appropriate information can cause anxiety and embarrassment when they start menstruating, while misconceptions about menstrual hygiene and bodily changes can perpetuate feelings of shame. 

### The Solution
We came up with a solution to this problem through our project, which aims to build a learning website for kids by providing comprehensive education to both boys and girls, dispelling myths, reducing stigma, and fostering empathy and respect for menstrual health, ensuring that all children are better informed and more supportive of each other. The goal is to teach both boys and girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way through a game-themed educational platform. Through quizzes, and challenges, kids will learn key facts about periods, menstrual hygiene, and the physical and emotional changes of puberty. The games will dispel common myths, encourage open discussions, and foster empathy and understanding. By making learning playful and non-intimidating, the platform will help break down the stigma surrounding menstruation, empowering kids to feel confident, informed, and supportive of one another.
